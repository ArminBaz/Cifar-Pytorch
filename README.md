## Cifar10 with Pytorch

### Introduction
The main objective is to get practice with Pytorch. To do this I am creating different well known models and applying each one to the Cifar10 dataset. <br>

Because I don't have access to a GPU, I am training these models using Google Colab (Thank you Google) for 100 epochs

### Requirements
* python 3.7
* torchvision 0.5.0
* numpy 1.17.2
* matplotlib 3.1.1
* barbar 0.2.1

### To Do:
- [x] BaseNet
- [x] ResNet
- [ ] DenseNet
- [ ] Inception V3
- [ ] VGG
- [ ] etc...

### Accuracies
- BaseNet ~ Training Accuracy : 90.8 | Testing Accuracy : 
- ResNet18 ~ Training Accuracy :
